        <h1><strong>F1 - ACROSS THE GLOBE</strong></h1>
        <p>The advancment of technology observed in the last century has made the world a smaller place. This has resulted
          in sports expanding into global spectacles - which no sport better demonstrates than <i><b>Formula 1</b></i>. F1
          has risen to become the pinnacle of motor-racing in the world and flaunts itself as such all across the globe. Advancements
          in travel, logistics, medicine and communication beg the question: how much entertainment can be spread how far across the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following visualisations will attempt to address this question by using statistics collected from the 71 seasons Formula 1 has
          provided.

          <p>The aforementioned improvements in travel have resulted in a large number of countries which, historically, did not have 
            a presence in Formula 1 producing drivers. The Formula 1 grand championship has seen over <strong>a thousand</strong> drivers
            participate hailing from all over the world. </p>

          The vast number of drivers that have participated in the championship is evident here as well as the large variety of nationalities
          these drivers have represented. There are drivers hailing from every majorly populated continent on the planet.</p>

          <h2>Increase in Races over the years</h2>
          <p>One trend that reflects the growht of Formula 1 over the years is that number of races that are held each season. It can be seen that
            the number of races has dramatically increased from merely <strong>7</strong> in Fromula 1's maiden season to the impressive <strong>23</strong>
            races the championship enndeavours to produce in 2022. </p>

          <h2>Cost of competition</h2>
          <p>It is a well known fact that competing in the championship is a costly venture with each individual constructor 
            having to spend millions upon millions of dollars to have a shot at the title.
            The cost of a championship title to a constructor has seen a steady increase over the years. Red Bull Racing spent <strong>167 million British Pounds</strong>
            in their 2008 championship seaons while Mercedes Petronas AMG finished their 2020 championship season having invested <strong> 459 million </strong>
            The increase in expediture can be explained with the sports globalisation as constructors are spending more and more on such things as the transporation
            of vehicles, team members and temporary operating facilites.
